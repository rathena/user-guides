# Hello~! What?!

Welcome to User Guides, the community driven guidebook for rAthena. This is a place where you can find guides on how to install, configure, and use rAthena. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the [rAthena Forums](https://rathena.org/board/) or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kMeMXWEvSV) server.

## Why Should I Use This?

This area of rAthena has been created by the community, for the community. If you have a guide you would like to share with the community, you can submit a pull request to the [rAthena User-Guides Repository](https://github.com/rathena/user-guides/) on GitHub. Due to the nature of how Github Wiki's work (and their access requirements for modifying them), we have decided to move our guides to a repository instead. This will allow us to have more control over the content and have a more streamlined process for submitting and reviewing guides. We hope you enjoy this new format, and we look forward to seeing your contributions!

## What About The Old Guides?

Guides that are currently located on the rA Wiki will slowly migrate over to here. If you are looking for a guide that is not yet on this site, you can find it on the [rAthena Wiki](https://rathena.org/wiki/).

There are a multitude of guides available on the forums, too, though many are extremely out-of-date and contain links to dead resources. Their authors may no longer be on the scene, which makes keeping them up-to-date a difficult task. This is why we encourage users to now make their guides available here, where they can be kept up-to-date and easily accessibleby everyone.
