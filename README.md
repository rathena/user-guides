# Welcome to User-Guides
A collection of user-submitted guides in markdown format, for both easy-reading and for automated generation via mkdocs.

The files inside `/guides/` are automatically generated by some fantastic software called MkDocs. MkDocs is a static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Each time a commit is pushed to the master branch, the site is automatically rebuilt and deployed to GitHub Pages by a Github Action. You can view the generated site at [https://rathena.github.io/user-guides/](https://rathena.github.io/user-guides/).

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, please read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development
You can use the included dockerfile to create a docker container for development. Run the following commands in the root directory of the project (where this file is).

### Build the container

`docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t ra-user-guides .`

This uses the same base image as the github actions, then installs the extra packages in `.github/requirements.txt`. You only need to do this once, or every time the list of requirements change.

### Run the container

`docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs ra-user-guides`

This runs the container we made in step one, mounts our current directory to `/docs` in the container, and opens the `8000` port. This will watch for changes as we make them. You can see the changes in your browser by going to `localhost:8000/user-guides`
